        <p class="text-xl">From my first "Hello World" in my debut app, I was hooked on software dev. It's more than a jobâ€”it's a thrill to level up my skills and craft top-notch software. What began as a simple intro has blossomed into a passion that only gets more exciting with time. So yeah, software dev isn't just what I do; it's my jam and my passion.</p>
